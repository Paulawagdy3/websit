One of the oldest of the European toy breeds, the Maltese has been a lap dog to royalty for centuries. This all-white dog has silky hair instead of fur, often making it more tolerable for those who are allergic. Maltese love to be pampered, cuddled and held, and typically form strong attachments. They are gentle and affectionate, and are easy to train, especially when training is started early. Maltese have a medium energy level and do well indoors or in Small Living Spaces.
